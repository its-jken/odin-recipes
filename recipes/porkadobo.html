    <p><h4>Description</h4></p>
    This is a recipe post for Filipino Pork Adobo. It is a dish composed of pork slices cooked in soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic.

    <br><p>Considered by some as the pride of Filipino cuisine, Pork Adobo is definitely a favorite among many around the world. For this, we cook pork slices in a perfect mix of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic to make this savory and sour viand. And I’ve got to say, it’s definitely a great way to introduce the world to what Pinoy cooks can make! But actually, there are other renditions of adobo. </p>
